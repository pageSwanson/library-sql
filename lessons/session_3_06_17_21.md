### What we'll cover today
- Introduction to INSERTS, UPDATES, and DELETES

### What is [CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete)?
- So far we've covered 'R', Reading data from storage using SQL
- SQL can be used for data manipulations as well
- The operations addressed here are considered only statements, rather than queries

#### [DELETE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delete_%28SQL%29)
- 'D', Deleting data
- DELETE statements are a part of data manipulation [DML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_manipulation_language)

```SQL
DELETE FROM facebook_info;
```

- used to delete data from a relational database
- Feel free to run this statement - though it will delete all of the content from our table
  - you can use the 'Revert Changes' feature of DBbrowser to restore the data

- Delete statements can have multiple clauses, similar to the `SELECT` query covered in the last session

- `DELETE FROM <object>` clause
  - starts with `DELETE` keyword
  - ends with the object relation, indicating which object we are deleting _from_
- optionally, include a `WHERE` clause
  - this clause has the same syntax / structure as with the `SELECT`
  
  ```SQL
  DELETE FROM facebook_info
  WHERE impressions > 2000
  ```

- NOTE: the SQLite [documentation](https://sqlite.org/lang_delete.html) also discusses how to use other clauses, but which have somewhat specific use cases.

#### [UPDATE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Update_%28SQL%29)
- 'U', Updating data
- UPDATE statements belong to the category of DML in a SQL implementation

```SQL
UPDATE facebook_info SET unique_clicks = 200;
```

- used to modify existing data in a database 
- running the above statement will update every entity within the facebook_info table
  - you can use the 'Revert Changes' feature of DBbrowser to restore the data as before

- Update statements have multiple clauses, and can take on 2 main forms supported by SQLite

- `UPDATE <object>` clause
  - starts with `UPDATE` keyword
  - ends with the identifier, indicating which object we are _updating_ 
- `... SET <attribute> = <value-expression> ...` clause
  - starts with the `SET` keyword
  - organized in pairs of attribute, value
    - the value can be an expressions, for example `impressions + 2`
  - for each additional attribute you want to update, separate with a comma
    - `... SET unique_clicks = 200, impressions = 300, ...`
- optionally, include a `WHERE` clause

  - this clause has the same syntax / structure as with the `SELECT` and `DELETE`
  - used to filter the entities that you want to be updated
  
  ```SQL
  UPDATE facebook_info SET impressions = impressions + 1000
  WHERE impressions < 2000
  ```

- NOTE: the SQLite [documentation](https://sqlite.org/lang_update.html) also discusses how to use the `FROM` clause so that you can make a selection of values and use that for your attribute value update

#### [INSERT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insert_%28SQL%29)
- 'C', Creating data
- INSERT statements are considered part of the DML

```SQL
INSERT into facebook_info VALUES (149, 'fb-6629', 4338);
```

- used to add data
- SQLite details 3 forms of [insert](https://sqlite.org/lang_insert.html)
- INSERT statements can have multiple clauses

- `INSERT INTO <object>` clause
- column-list clause (or not)
  - `(ad_id, fb_id, impressions, ...)`
  - an optional clause indicating which attributes to populate for the new entity being created
  - if you omit, depending on the schema
    - use the Database Structure view to determine value order in this case
    - defaults may be used
    - unspecified attributes may be null
    - an error may occur - indicating that a value must be provided

- here things diverge, and you can add one of 3 clauses

- the `VALUES (...)` clause
  - follows the column-list if present
  - otherwise, follows the object identifier (the object of the insert)
  - `VALUES (149, 'fb-6629', 4338, ...)`
    - the appearance of each value in the list must match the order of columns
    - if you specify columns (attributes) as a list, match this order
    - if you don't specify, you must provide all values - schema order is expected
  
  ```SQL
  INSERT INTO facebook_info
  -- unspecified, order is: 
  -- ad_id, fb_id, impressions, unique_reach, unique_clicks, engagement_rate
  VALUES (150, 'fb-6923', 1409, null, null, null);
  ```

- the `SELECT ...` clause
  - follows the column-list if present, or the object identifier
  - use this clause to read data
  - selected attributes must conform to the insert clause attribute order
  - `... SELECT ad_id, fb_id, impressions ...`
  - a `WHERE` clause can be used as with a typical select to filter data added

  ```SQL
  INSERT INTO facebook_info ad_id, fb_id
  SELECT ad_id, fb_id FROM facebook_info
  WHERE ad_id = 148;
  ```

- the `DEFAULT VALUES` keywords
  - follows the column-list if present, or the object identifier
  - this just means that defaults will be used if present
  - null will be used otherwise
  
  ```SQL
  INSERT INTO facebook_info DEFAULT VALUES;
  ```
