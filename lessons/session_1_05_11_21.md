### Helpful resource
- Deep + fast overview of SQL syntax
  - https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/sql/

### What the series will cover
- Introduction to SQL queries
- Databases
  - modifying databases
- More complex queries
- Using our database in code

### What is [SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL)?
- SQL provides a way to build sentences
  - ask questions about data: [SELECT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Select_(SQL))
    - filter some data
    - organize data
    - relate data to other data
    - introduce new data
    - update existing data
    - delete it
- sentences are called 'queries'
- a query has to meet a certain syntax
  - SQL is a standard
  - there are many different implementations
  of the standard

#### common implementations
- [PostgreSQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostgreSQL) (Postgres)
  - open-source, multi-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- [MySQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL)
  - open-source, multi-platform
- [Microsoft SQL Server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_SQL_Server)
  - includes T-SQL (extending standard SQL), integration w/ C# coding language
- [SQLite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQLite)
  - open-source, multi-platform, portable (single file)

#### We'll use [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/whentouse.html)
- it's portable
- it's open source
- has good interface support
- it's simple to configure

#### What is a [database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database)?
- a database is a structure for keeping data 
- specifically a relational database
  - maintains a schema
  - conveys relationships between pieces of data
  - uses tables, columns, rows
  - data within the table is 'typed'

### Required Tools

#### text editor
- [Atom](https://atom.io/)
- [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)
  - simple editor for Windows
- [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)

#### dbbrowser
- use for browsing the database contained in a SQLite file
- https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser
- https://www.boxplotanalytics.com/using-db-browser-for-sqlite/
  - feel free to browse these instructions
  - in sessions ahead, we'll explore these topics

### Next session
- using SELECT queries to find data
- filtering the data with WHERE clauses
