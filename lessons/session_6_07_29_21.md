### Reminders
- [office hours](https://calendly.com/coder-nhfpl) every Monday from 6:30 to 8:30
- coder@nhfpl.org

### What we'll cover today
- Reading from a SQLite file with database server
- Transmit the data as a request response

### Creating the database

#### using the [database script](https://github.com/pageSwanson/library-sql/blob/main/scripts/bottle_schema.sql) we created before
- stand up a simple database with table
  - you can run the script content @ [sqliteonline](https://sqliteonline.com/)
  - first, drop the table using the lefthand side (right click 'demo')

- save the file somewhere on your computer
  - use the 'File' dropdown at top left
  - I'm saving it in the 'serving' folder, next to the web service file

- we'll use this as the data source when sending data to our page

### Reading data from the database
- using the [sqlite library](https://dyedgreen.github.io/deno-sqlite/#/)
- access the database we made
- this [example](https://dyedgreen.github.io/deno-sqlite/#/examples?id=server-example) can serve as a guide

#### Import the library and open the file
- do this at the top of the `webserver.ts` file
```typescript
import { DB } from "https://deno.land/x/sqlite/mod.ts";

// open the database file
const db = new DB("sqlite.db");
```

#### Inside of the request handler `if` statement
- define the type of data we want to respond with

```typescript
const data: Array<string> = [];
```

#### Start a query and handle the results

```typescript
// read this as 'for every row that we select with our query'
for (
    const [color, material, volume, manufactured_where] of
    db.query(`SELECT color, material, volume_milliliters, manufactured_where FROM bottle_info`)
) {
    console.log(color as string, material as string, volume as number, manufactured_where as string);
    // add the items from the row as one long string
    data.push(
        `color: ${color}, material: ${material}, volume: ${volume}, manufactured_where: ${manufactured_where}`
    );
}
```

#### Respond to the request with the data
```typescript
requestEvent.respondWith(
    // we expect a string - so create a string from the list
    // separate each item onto a separate line
    new Response(data.join(`\n`), {
        status: 200,
    }),
);
continue;
```

### Open the console to view the data
- with the code in our index.html script
- we unload the response and print to the console

### Add a new request
- How would we add data to the database?

### Add a button to the page
- Add a simple button, from the MDN reference

#### connect it to the request
- connect to the webserver with a new request
- hook up the button using event handlers

### Extending this project
- add new types of requests
  - new selections, deleting data
- display the data on your page
  - tabulate the data
- add forms for users to submit data
  - make requests with the information from the form

### Next sessions
- A series on problem-solving with code
