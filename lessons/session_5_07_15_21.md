### Helpful resources
- create a database on your web page
  - all within the browser

### Reminders
- [office hours](https://calendly.com/coder-nhfpl) every Monday from 6:30 to 8:30
- coder@nhfpl.org

### What we'll cover today
- Making a basic (empty!) web page
- Starting a web server
- Connecting to a SQLite file

### Download and install [Deno](https://deno.land/manual@v1.12.0/getting_started/installation)
- we'll be using Deno as a web server
  - a versatile server-side javascript environment
  - usually javascript is run from the browser (on webpages)
  - something like Deno gives us a 'run-time' environment
  - we can run javascript nearly anywhere
- Deno has a lot of great features
  - explicit permissions options
  - great standard library inclusions (works out of the box)

### Creating the database

#### using the [database script](https://github.com/pageSwanson/library-sql/blob/main/scripts/bottle_schema.sql) we created before
- stand up a simple database with table
  - you can run the script content @ [sqliteonline](https://sqliteonline.com/)
  - first, drop the table using the lefthand side (right click 'demo')
- save the file somewhere on your computer
  - use the 'File' dropdown at top left
- we'll use this as the data source to read from our page

### Creating the html page

#### html content
- we just need a [basic document](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Getting_started#anatomy_of_an_html_document)
- we'll add javascript to connect to the database

#### script tag
- add this tag just above the body

```html
<script>
    // make a web request
    // connect to the server (the computer)
    // get a response with our database data
</script>
```

#### view the content
- visit the page you created by navigating in your browser
- for myself, the url was:

`file:///Users/kswa/Downloads/public/index.html`

### Creating the web server
- Deno is great to setup as a [web server](https://deno.land/manual/examples/http_server)
- the gist is that we are indefinitely checking for requests
- requests will come from the html page we created above
  - our browser sends them
  - our web server receives them

- follow the example at the link above
  - create a file with the content
- run the command associated

```bash
deno run --allow-net --unstable webserver.ts
```

- visit [your local host](http://localhost:8080/)
  - confirm the server is up!

### Sending requests

#### back to the script tag
- making use of the [fetch api](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) in javascript
- create a basic GET request within our tag
  - a GET is a simple HTTP request form
  - typically resigned to retrieving data
- [javascript.info](https://javascript.info/fetch) provides a great tutorial on using it
  - NOTE: this doesn't work in internet explorer (but fine for edge)
- in our code, we'll use the `.text()` method
  - and just print the content to the console

- ... but this doesn't work
- because we're not _serving_ the html file with our new server
- we need to update webserver.ts so that it serves our page

### Handling requests
- back to Deno, we can respond to a request with the serve api

- we'll add the following to serve the html file
```javascript
if (requestEvent.request.url == url) {
    // Read the index.html file and serve it, using Deno
    const html_file = await Deno.readFile('public/index.html');

    requestEvent.respondWith(
        new Response(html_file, {
            status: 200,
        }),
    );
}
```

- restart the server, but update the command:
```bash
deno run --allow-net --allow-read --unstable webserver.ts
```

- we should see our html page
- ... but, our request isn't completing
- add a response for the data 'endpoint'

```javascript
if (requestEvent.request.url == url + 'api/data') {
    console.log('hey I got your message!');
    const body = `Get your data shortly`;
    requestEvent.respondWith(
        new Response(body, {
            status: 200,
        }),
    );
}
```

### Reading data from the database
- using the [sqlite library](https://dyedgreen.github.io/deno-sqlite/#/)
- access the database we made
- this [example](https://dyedgreen.github.io/deno-sqlite/#/examples?id=server-example) can serve as a guide

### Open the console to view the data

### Extending this project
- add new types of requests
  - adding data, deleting it
- display the data on your page
  - tabulate the data
- add forms for users to submit data
  - make requests with the information from the form

### Next session
