### Reminders
- [office hours](https://calendly.com/coder-nhfpl) every Monday from 6:30 to 8:30
- coder@nhfpl.org

### What we'll cover today
- Making a basic (empty!) web page
- Starting a web server
- Connecting to a SQLite file

### Download and install [Deno](https://deno.land/manual@v1.12.0/getting_started/installation)
- we'll be using Deno as a web server
  - a versatile server-side javascript environment
  - usually javascript is run from the browser (on webpages)
  - something like Deno gives us a 'run-time' environment
  - we can run javascript nearly anywhere
- Deno has a lot of great features
  - explicit permissions options
  - great standard library inclusions (works out of the box)

### Creating the html page

#### html content
- we just need a [basic document](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Getting_started#anatomy_of_an_html_document)
- we'll add javascript to connect to the database

#### script tag
- add this tag just above the body

```html
<script>
    // make a web request
    // connect to the server (the computer)
    // get a response with our database data
</script>
```

#### view the content
- visit the page you created by navigating in your browser
- for myself, the url was:

`file:///Users/kswa/Downloads/public/index.html`

### Creating the web server
- Deno is great to setup as a [web server](https://deno.land/manual/examples/http_server)
- the gist is that we are indefinitely checking for requests from other pages
- requests will come from the html page we created above
  - our browser sends them
  - our web server receives them

- follow the example at the link above
  - create a file with the javascript content
- run the command associated

```bash
deno run --allow-net --unstable webserver.ts
```

- visit [your local host](http://localhost:8080/)
  - confirm the server is up!

### Sending requests

#### back to the script tag
- making use of the [fetch api](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) in javascript
- create a basic GET request within our tag
  - a GET is a simple HTTP request form
  - typically resigned to retrieving data
- [javascript.info](https://javascript.info/fetch) provides a great tutorial on using it
  - NOTE: this doesn't work in internet explorer (but fine for edge)

- in our code, we'll use the `.text()` method
  - and just print the content to the console

- taking the example, and modifying to get the text from the response
  - NOTE: we also surround the code with the 'async' keyword
  - means that the following code needs to used [asynchronously](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Asynchronous)
  - put this inside of the script tag

```html
<script>
  // make a web request
  // connect to the server (the computer)
  (async () => {
    let url = 'http://localhost:8080/api/data';
    let response = await fetch(url);

    if (response.ok) { // if HTTP-status is 200-299
        // get the response body (the method explained below) text
        // get a response with our database data
        let body = await response.text();
        console.log(body);
    } else {
        alert("HTTP-Error: " + response.status);
    }
  })();
</script>
```

- ... but this doesn't work
- because we're not _serving_ the html file with our new server
    - you can read more about this problem [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS/Errors)
- we need to update webserver.ts so that it serves our page

### Serve the index.html page
- back to using Deno, we'll edit the webserver.ts file

- We need to support the base request for loading the page from the server
- Once we're ready to handle requests, respond with the index file content
  - just after the `for await (const requestEvent of httpConn) {` line

```typescript
if (requestEvent.request.url == url) {
    // The native HTTP server uses the web standard `Request` and `Response`
    // objects.

    // Read the index.html file
    const index_content = await Deno.readFile('public/index.html');

    // ...  and serve it!
    // The requestEvent's `.respondWith()` method is how we send the response
    // back to the client.
    requestEvent.respondWith(
        new Response(index_content, {
            status: 200,
        }),
    );
}
```

#### Restart the server, but update the command
- we need to change the command used so that we can read from files
- NOTE: stop the current process with `Ctrl + C`

```bash
deno run --allow-net --allow-read --unstable webserver.ts
```

- visit [your local host](http://localhost:8080/) and you should see the page

### Handling requests
- Now that our webserver.ts serves our page
- We can respond to additional requests

- add a response for the data 'endpoint'
    - this code after the `if (requestEvent.request.url == url) { ... }` section

```typescript
// if the request is to a url that matches 'http://localhost:8080/api/data'
// the following code will execute
if (requestEvent.request.url == url + 'api/data') {
    // add a console entry to debug
    console.log('You requested data');

    // store our data in the response 'body'
    const body = `Data will be here`;

    // respond to the request with the requested data
    requestEvent.respondWith(
        new Response(body, {
            status: 200,
        }),
    );
    continue;
}
```

- stop the webserver, and restart it to update the code
- when you visit your page again, you should see the completed request!

### Next session
- Read data from the database file with our web server
