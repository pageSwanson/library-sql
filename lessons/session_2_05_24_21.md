### What we'll cover today
- Introduction to SQL syntax and SELECT statements

### What is a [SELECT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Select_(SQL) statement?
> The scope of SQL includes data query, data manipulation (insert, update and delete), data definition (schema creation and modification), and data access control (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL)

- SELECT statements are a data query
```SQL
SELECT * FROM facebook_info;
```
- used to seek data and deliver it

#### syntax
- structure ([syntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_syntax))
- specific statements adhere to different syntax
- SELECT statements can have multiple clauses
  - `SELECT` clause
    - starts with the `SELECT` keyword
    - includes _selected_ attributes
    - `SELECT * ...`
      - `*` (star) indicates all atributes be selected
  - `FROM` clause
    - starts w/ `FROM` keyword
    - `... FROM facebook_info`
      - use identifiers to clarify relations
      - _relate_ to the table 'facebook_info'
- more clauses can be used to configure the presentation of results

#### filters (the `WHERE` clause)
```SQL
SELECT * FROM facebook_info
WHERE unique_clicks < 1000;
```
- starts w/ `WHERE` keyword
  - `... WHERE unique_clicks < 1000`
- contains a predicate
  - from predicate logic, statement that evaluates as [true, false, or unknown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_syntax#Null_or_three-valued_logic_(3VL))
- predicates use operators to resolve an expression to a logical evaluation
  - is this true? return the row
  - is this false? don't return it
  - is this unknown? dont' return it
- operators include
  - `... WHERE impressions > 1000`
    - supports `<`, `>=`, `<=`
  - `... WHERE impressions = 2796`
  - `... WHERE impressions <> 2796`
  - `... WHERE fb_id LIKE 'fb-____'`
    - `... WHERE fb_id NOT LIKE ...`
    - `... WHERE fb_id LIKE 'fb-%'`

#### additional capabilities
- `DISTINCT` means duplicate attribute values appear only once
- aggregates
  - using `COUNT(unique_reach)` indicates the total number of records
  - using `SUM(unique_reach)` totals attribute values across records
  - using `MAX(unique_reach)` returns only the maximum value for the selected attribute
- in-place calculation
  - you can select literals and change the way attributes manifest in your selection
  - `SELECT impressions + 18 ...`
  - `SELECT impressions || '-updated' ...`
- aliasing
  - usually used for an evaluated property
  - `SELECT impressions + 18 as UpdatedImpressions ...`
- ordering
  - the `ORDER BY` clause
  - `... ORDER BY`
  - by default, order is ascending
