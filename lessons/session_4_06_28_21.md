### Reminders
- [office hours](https://calendly.com/coder-nhfpl) every Monday from 6:30 to 8:30
- coder@nhfpl.org

### What we'll cover today
- Guest speaker
- Introduction to Schema and [DDL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_definition_language) (data definition language)
- Using what we know to setup a new database
  - Make a [script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripting_language) that produces the same schema each time
  - "automates the execution of tasks that would otherwise be performed individually by a human operator"

### What is [Schema](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_schema)_?
- comes from the greek word for 'shape'
- Generally: "structure described in a formal language supported by the database management system"
- "blueprint of how the database is constructed (divided into database tables in the case of relational databases)"

- Viewing schema information in SQLite
  - the 'Database Structure' tab in DB Browser
  - left-hand side of the page for sqliteonline

### What data?
- using an insert statement as the definition
- this is what we'll build the database around

```SQL INSERT INTO bottle_info
(id, color, construction, volume_milliliters, is_clear) 
VALUES 
(1, 'green', 'glass', 1000, 'true'),
(2, 'blue', 'glass', 600, 'true'),
(3, null, 'plastic', 400, 'true'),
(4, 'brown', 'plastic', 500, 'true')
```

### Create the schema
#### [CREATE TABLE](https://sqlite.org/lang_createtable.html)
- use this to create tables in our schema

#### Create a table
- want to know beforehand:
  - the name
  - some of the basic columns and their names
  - the datatypes for those columns [datatype](https://sqlite.org/datatype3.html)

  ```SQL
  CREATE TABLE 
  IF NOT EXISTS
  'bottle_info' ( 
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  color TEXT,
  construction TEXT,
  volume_milliliters REAL,
  is_clear TEXT
  )
  ```

- `PRIMARY KEY`
  - indicates that this column can be used to uniquely identify rows in the table
  - this is the column we'd use mostly when addressing this table

- `IF NOT EXISTS` clause
  - will help us avoid a failure if the object already exists
  - use for scripts you'd like to run again

### Modify the schema 
#### [ALTER TABLE](https://sqlite.org/lang_altertable.html)
- use this to update existing schema objects
- you can always use alter to modify schema after you created it

#### Add a column
- we realize that we forgot to add a column
- want to indicate where the bottle is manufactured
- specify details
  - 'manufactured_where'
  - TEXT type

  ```SQL
  ALTER TABLE
  bottle_info
  ADD COLUMN
  manufactured_where TEXT
  ```

#### Modify a column object
- we realize that our 'construction' column could have a better name
- we want to update the column to be called 'material'

```SQL
ALTER TABLE
bottle_info
RENAME COLUMN
construction TO
material
```

### 'Undo' a schema change, or remove an object
- what if we accidentally created an object?
- can we 'delete' objects like data

#### [DROP TABLE](https://sqlite.org/lang_droptable.html)
- use this to modify schema by removing objects, such as tables
- make sure you identify the object correctly!

```SQL
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS bottle_info
```

- `IF EXISTS` clause
  - will help us avoid a failure if the object isn't there
  - use for scripts that need to run multiple times

#### Remove a column
- we decide that we don't need to know whether a bottle is clear

```SQL
ALTER TABLE bottle_info DROP COLUMN is_clear
```

- NOTE to DB Browser users, this command isn't supported
  - instead, you would want to drop the table, and start from scratch
  - this time around, exclude the column you wanted to drop

- if we want to drop the id column, we get an error
- we would have to `DROP TABLE` first, then recreate the table without the column
  - would need to choose a different `PRIMARY KEY`

### Add our data
- Given that our schema is in place, we can add the data

```SQL
INSERT INTO bottle_info
(id, color, material, volume_milliliters, manufactured_where) 
VALUES 
(1, 'green', 'glass', 1000, 'US'),
(2, 'blue', 'glass', 600, 'IT'),
(3, null, 'plastic', 400, 'US'),
(4, 'brown', 'plastic', 500, 'MX')
```
